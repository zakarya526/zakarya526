### What I Do

I work across the full stack — from native mobile UIs to backend services and database architecture. Currently focused on building autonomous AI-agent systems that integrate into real developer workflows.

**Day-to-day:** TypeScript, React Native, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Docker

**AI & Agents:** Claude Code, MCP, LangChain, multi-agent orchestration, RAG pipelines

### What I've Built

🏢 **Enterprise Event Platform** — Multi-tenant event management system with complex auth flows, real-time guestlist management, and cross-platform mobile apps (iOS + Android) serving thousands of users.

🤖 **Agentic Developer Tooling** — Autonomous coding workflows using LLMs — agents that review PRs, refactor code, and integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

📱 **Production Mobile Apps** — React Native applications with native-level performance, handling ticket redemption, QR scanning, and offline-first architectures.

🔧 **Internal SaaS Platform** — Operations and finance management tool built with Express, TypeScript, MongoDB backend and Next.js + Mantine frontend.

### How I Think About Engineering

- **Ship, then iterate.** Production exposure beats theoretical perfection.
- **Systems over features.** Good architecture makes the next 100 features easier.
- **AI as a multiplier.** I don't just use AI tools — I build systems around them.
- **Make the next developer's life easier** — including the AI ones.
